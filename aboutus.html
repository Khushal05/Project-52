My name is KHUSHAL GUNDALA I study in class 8 and I am a coder who is learning coding in Whitehat Jr and I have
created this website on my own as I think step by step diagrams are probably the most popular and easiest to 
follow way to show how to fold things out of paper.Trying to find good origami instructions on the Internet 
can be a lot of work though.To help your search I have put together the largest database of free origami 
diagrams anywhere on the Internet.
